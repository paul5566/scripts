# Spack

> Spack is a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and
> configurations of software on a wide variety of platforms and environments. It
> was designed for large supercomputing centers, where many users and
> application teams share common installations of software on clusters with
> exotic architectures, using libraries that do not have a standard ABI. Spack
> is non-destructive: installing a new version does not break existing
> installations, so many configurations can coexist on the same system.
