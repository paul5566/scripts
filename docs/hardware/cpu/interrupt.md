* Interrupt are **signals to the processor** indicating an event that needs immediate attention
  - Triggered by **external event** (change in pin state) or **internal event** (a timer or a software signal)
  - Asynchronous processing outside of the regular flow of a program
* Pauses the current processor activity and calls an **ISR** (Interrupt Service Routine)
