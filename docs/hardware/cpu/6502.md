### Registers

```bash
PC      Program Counter   16bit
SP      Stack Pointer      8bit
A       Accumulator        8bit
X       Index Register X   8bit
Y       Index Register Y   8bit
```

Processor Status, 8bit:

```bash
NV-BDIZC
||||||||
`--------- N: Negative Flag
 `-------- V: Overflow Flag
  `------- non
   `------ B: Break Command
    `----- D: Decimal Mode
     `---- I: Interrupt Disable
      `--- Z: Zero Flag
       `-- C: Carry Flag
```

* Program Counter
  - Points to the next instruction to be executed
  - Modified automatically as instructions are executed
  - Modified by executing a jump
* Stack Pointer
  - Low 8 bits of the next free location on the stack
  - Push/pull increment/decrement the stack pointer
  - CPU does not detect a stack overflow
* Accumulator
  - Used for arithmetic and logical operations
  - Stored and retrieved either from memory or the stack
* Index Registers
  - Most commonly used to hold counters or offsets for accessing memory
  - Can be loaded/saved to memory
  - X: can copy/change the stack pointer
* Processor Status
  - N: set if the result of the last operation had bit 7 set to a one
  - V: set during arithmetic operations, invalid 2's complement result
  - B: `BRK` instruction has been executed and an interrupt has been generated
  - D: set to obey the rules of Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) arithmetic
  - I: processor will not respond to interrupts from devices
  - Z: result of the last operation as was zero
  - C: last opperation, overflow from bit 7, or underflow from bit 0
