## Machine Code

Machine code (machine language) ➜ **instructions** executed by a processor 

* Instruction ➜ **operation code** (opcode), **operand**
* Operand ➜ (memory address to the) data to operate on 
* Opcodes & operands encoded as **binary code**
* Machine code **programm** ➜ sequence of instructions (opcodes & operands) 
* **Assembly language**
  - Symbolic representation of machine instructions
  - Symbolic names for opcodes ➜ **mnemonic codes**
* **Assembler** ➜ translates assembly language into machine code

### Object Code

Object code is a sequence of instructions in machine code generated by an assembler

* Executable programs are typically build from reusable **code fragments** (sub-program, function/modules)
  - Fragments get individually compiled (translated) into object code
  - A complete program it then build by combining various object code fragments
  - Individual fragments are referenced using a **symbol** (function name)
* **Object file** (relocatable format machine code)
  - File format use to store object code and related data (e.g. ELF)
  - Structured as separated **segments**/sections of different types of data
* A **linker** program combines object code to generate executable machine code
  - **Relocation** assigns load addresses to various object code fragments
  - A linker resolves symbols using assigned memory locations and patching the calling object code to that location (call instruction reference)
* A **loader** places executable machine code into (main) memory and prepares it for execution
  - Allocates regions in memory corresponding to segments in the machine code
  - A program loader is part of a computer operating system (starts the program once its loader)
  - A microcontroller typically do not have a loader, instead the executable machine code is starter directly from memory

### Object Files

Object files contain five kinds of information

* Header: Metadata, code size, format specification, etc.
* Object code: Binary instructions and data generated by an assembler(/compiler)
* Relocation: List of places in the object code a linker needs to change the address of
* Symbols: Global symbols defined in the module, symbols to be imported from other modules
* Debugging: Information about the object code need by the linker for debugging

ELF (Executable and Linking Format) file com in three flavors:

* Relocatable: Create by assemblers(/compilers), need to processed by a linker
* Executable: Address relocation done, symbols resolved (except for shared library symbols), ready for execution
* Shared object: Shared libraries including symbol information for linkers and executable code for run-time
