# Mechanical Keyboards

Mechanical keyboards use a mechanical mechanism (key switch) 
to record a key stroke:

Most keyboards are not mechanical, broadly two categories:

* **Capacitive** (most common type of keyboard)
  - Designed to be cheap an easy to produce
  - Light "squishy",  quiet typing experience
  - Rubber domes over a membrane contact sheet
  - Do not physically complete a circuit
  - Change in current flow on the key matrix detected by the processor
  - Rated at 1-10 million key strokes
* **Mechanical**
  - Designed for quality and durability
  - More comfortable and enjoyable typing experience
  - Better precision in gaming
  - Different level of audible and tactile response
  - More durable 20-100 million key strokes

### Qualities

The "feel" of a keyboard varies depending on the following qualities:

* Switch types (force, feedback)
* Switch mount construction
* Case construction (sturdiness, angel, tilt)
* Keycap construction (shape, size)
* Keycap print (readability)

### Sizes

List of keyboard sizes [05]:

* **Full-size**, 100%, 104/105 keys
  - Alphanumeric keys
  - Arrow keys (navigation cluster)
  - Function keys (F-row)
  - Number pad
* **96-key**
  - All 100% keyboard keys
  - More compact form factor
  - No space between the different key clusters
* **Tenkeyless** (TKL)
  - 80% off a full size keyboard
  - Does not have a number pad
* **75%**, ~84 keys
  - No number pad
  - Arrow keys
  - Function keys
  - Some control keys
  - More compact form factor then TKL
* **65%**, ~65 keys
  - No number pad
  - No function keys
  - Arrow keys
  - Some control keys (PgUp, PgDn, Ins, Del)
* **60%**, ~61 keys
  - No number pad
  - No function keys
  - No arrow keys

Typically missing keys are available on a  different layer 
accessed by an `Fn` function key.
