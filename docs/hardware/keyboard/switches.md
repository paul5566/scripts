## Switches

On mechanical keyboards the switch determines how typing feels.

### Switch Types

Mechanical switches, divided into three categories:

* Linear (i.e. Cherry MX Red)
  - Recommended for a quieter environment
  - Consistent (straight-down), smooth key press
  - No tactile feedback (bump)
  - No audible click noise
  - More rapid actuation
  - Resistance increases in a linear fashion along the travel of the key
* Tactile (i.e. Cherry MX Brown)
  - More ergonomic and fluid typing experience
  - Tactile feedback, noticeable bump in the middle of travel
  - Bump is located at the point of actuation, where a key press is registered
  - Indication of a press without needing to bottom out your keys
* Clicky (i.e. Cherry MX Blue)
  - Like a tactile switch
  - Distinct “click” sound when the key is activated

### Characteristics

* Operation Force (measured in centinewton (cN) or gram-force (gf))
  - Light 0-55 cN
  - Medium 55-75 cN
  - Heavy 75-95 cN
  - Super Heavy 95+ cN
* Actuation Point (measured in millimeters)
  - Point where a keypress is recognized by the keyboard
  - Typically 1.1 - 2.5 mm
* Travel Distance (measured in millimeters)
  - Distance until the key press reaches the bottom
  - Typically 3.5 - 4 mm
* Reset Point - Distance at which the key is deactivated when released
* Durability (measured in number of key presses)
  - 50 - 80 million for metal contact
  - more then 100 million for optical
* Hot-swappable vs. soldered switches
