# OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)

Use organic materials that **emit light when electricity is applied**

* ...rather then blocking light like LCDs
* Series of organic thin films between two conductors
* Emissive displays that do not require backlight, or color filters
* Only an “on” pixel consumes power

Improvements over LCDs:

* Ultra-thin form factor
* Lower power consumption
* Better durability (broader temperature range)
* Long-lasting lifetime (up to 55.000 hours)
* Faster refresh rates
* Improved image quality
* Better contrast
* Higher brightness
* Wider viewing angle
* Wider color range
* Can be...
  - Transparent
  - Flexible
  - Foldable
  - Rollable
  - Sretchable

## Driving Methods

**PMOLED** (passive matrix OLED)

- Control each row in the display sequentially (one at a time)
- No (active) storage capacitor
- Limits in size & resolution by max. input voltage (typical <3")
- Cheap fabrication compared to AMOLED
- Lower lifetime

**AMOLED** (active matrix OLED)

- Use (active-matrix) TFT array with storage capacitor 
- Less power then PMOLEDs
- Faster refresh rate
- Supports larger high-resolution displays
