# Quantum Dot Displays

**QLED** (quantum dot light emitting diodes):

* Light emitters, cadmium selenide (CdSe) **nano-scale crystals**
  - Quantum dots (QD): conducting nano-crystals with 2nm to 10nm diameter
  - Color of light produced or filtered by a dot is based on its diameter
* Sandwiched between electron-transporting & hole-transporting organic materials
* Applied electric field causes electrons and holes to move into the quantum dot
  layer, where they are captured to emit photons.

Improvements over OLED:

* 30-40% luminance efficiency advantage over OLED
* Up to 50% less power consumption the over OLED
