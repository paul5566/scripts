## LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)

* Works by **adjusting the amount of light blocked**
* Array of liquid crystal segments (containing organic molecules)
  - Organized in a random pattern when not electric field is applied
  - Within an electric field crystals align perpendicular to a light source
  - Crystals "gate" the amount of light that can pass through
* A light source - **backlight** - needs to drive light through the crystals
* **TFT** type of an LCD with a thin film transistor attached to each pixel
  - Amplifies each pixel (higher contrast ratio)
  - Pixel hold electrical state
  - Pixel more rapidly switched (faster response time (25ms))

**Color filters** allow the generation of colors (RGB) at a segment:

- Three segments required to generate a real world color
- Light passes individually through red/grenn/blue filter segments
- These segments for a group, **RGB pixel**

I.e. a 320x240 RGB display is formed by 960 columns and 240 rows
