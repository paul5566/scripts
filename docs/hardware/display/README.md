Physiological aspect of the human eye:

* Visual field: approx. 200°, 120° binocular overlap
* Retinal resolution 0.3 to 0.7 arc minutes (depends on task/luminance)
* Temporal resolution: approx 50Hz (increases with luminance)
* Three types of photoreceptors:
  - Blur (450nm +/-30)
  - Green (550nm +/-40)
  - Red (600nm +/-35)

# Displays

Display device is an output device to present information.

Electronic visual display (informally screen) technologies:

* **CRT** (cathode ray tube) 
* Segment display
* **LCD** (liquid crystal display)
  - **TFT** (thin-film transistor) LCD 
  - LCD with LED backlit
* **OLED** (organic light-emitting diode display)
* Plasma (plasma display panel)
* QLED (quantum dot LED)

Displays emitting light called **active**. 

Displays modulating available light (reflection/transmission) called **passive**.
