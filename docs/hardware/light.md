## Light

Part of the **electromagnetic spectrum** that is **perceived by our eyes**

**Wavelength between 380 and 780 nm**

Light has a triple effect:

- **Visual** illumination (glare-free and convenient)
- **Emotional** perception (creating mood and comfort)
- **Biological** effects (circadian rhythm, stimulation or relaxing)

## Types of Electric Light Sources

**Incandescent** lamps (Glühlampe)

- Sends electric current through a thin wire called a filament
- The filament is mostly of **tungsten** (Wolfram)
- Resistance heats the filament until it glows producing light & heat

**Halogen** lamps are a more efficient incandescent lamps

**Fluorescent** lamps (a type of gas discharge lamp)

- I.e. **mercury vapor** emits ultraviolet to excite **phosphor** which emits light
- More expensive, longer life, less energy (than an incandescent lamps)

**LED** (light-emitting diode)

- **Semiconductor** device that produces light from electricity
- Less expensive (more efficient), longer life (than all other sources)

## Light Parameters

Name                |                    | Symbol  | Unit
--------------------|--------------------|---------|------
Luminous flux       | Lichtstrom         | Φ (Phi) | **lm** (Lumen)
Luminous intensity  | Lichtstärke        | Ι       | **cd** (Candela) 
Illuminance         | Beleuchtungsstärke | E       | **lx** (Lux)
Luminance           | Leuchtdichte       | L       | **cd/m²**
Luminous efficiency | Lichtausbeute      |         | **lm/W** (Lumens per Watt)

* Luminous intensity
  - Quantity of **light radiated in a particular direction**
  - Represented by the luminous intensity distribution curve (LDC)
* Illuminance - Quantity of **luminous flux falling on a surface**
* Luminance - **Brightness** that is perceived by the eye

## Luminous Flux

Measure of **quantity of light emitted**...

* ...by a light source (accounts for the **sensitivity of the eye**)...
* ...weighting the power at each wavelength with the **luminosity function** 

Source                                 | Lumen (lm)
---------------------------------------|----------
Simple LED diode                       | <1
Candle                                 | 10
Kerosene lantern                       | 100
Incandescent light bulb (40W,230V)     | 430
High-output white LED (7W)             | 450
Fluorescent tube (30W,895mm)           | 1600
Xenon bulb (35W)                       | >2200
Sun                                    | 3.7·10²⁸

## Luminous Efficacy

**Ratio of the luminous flux to the electrical power** consumed (lm/W)

Source                             | lm/W 
-----------------------------------|---------------
Tungsten incandescent light bulb   | 12.5-17.5
Halogen lamp 	                   | 16-24
Mercury vapor lamp 	           | 35-65
Fluorescent lamp 	           | 45-75
LED lamp 	                   | 80-100
Metal halide lamp 	           | 75-100
High pressure sodium vapor lamp    | 85-150
Low pressure sodium vapor lamp 	   | 100-200

It is a measure of a light source’s **economic efficiency**

## Light Colour

Colour Temp.        | Appearance   | Association
--------------------|--------------|-------------------
up to 3300K         | reddish      | warm
3300-5300K          | white        | neutral
more than 5300K     | bluish       | cool

**Melanopic effect** of light:

- Blue light suppresses the sleep hormone melatonin
- Melatonin is responsible for a good sleep at night
- **Right light controls the circadian rhythm** (circadiane Rhythmik)...
- ..thus a healthy waking and sleeping behaviour

## Electric Light Bulb Socket

Standard socket for interior lighting is called **Edison screw**:

* Right-hand threaded metal bases (caps) which...
* ...screw into matching threaded sockets (lamp holders)
* **Thread** connected to **neutral**, **buttom tip** connected to **main phase**

Countries with 220–240V use typically use

* Edison screw-mounts: **E27** (27mm) & **E14** (14mm)
* Type G **Bi-post** (pin) lamp bases: **GU10** (10mm)
