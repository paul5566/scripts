## Microphones

**Dynamic** microphones used for live broadcast, podcasts, voice-over:

* Passive (does not need an extra power source)
* Durable (can handle very loud sound) 
* Good at background noise rejection
* Low sensitivity, low output level
* Usually no full frequency response

**Condenser** microphones provide a more natural sound and are used in studios for 
music recording:

* Powered (requires a power source connection) aka phantom power
* Fragile (can be over-driven by loud sound)
* Wider range of frequency response
* Higher sensitivity, higher output level
* Require a controlled environment (no background noise)

Additional equipment desk recording:

* Microphone stand
* Shock mount
* Pop filter or wind screen
