## Studio Monitors

Loudspeakers giving an **accurate reproduction of the tonal qualities of the source audio** (flat frequency response), no relative phase shift of particular frequencies.

* Used for **audio mixing and mastering**, enable audio engineers to create sound pleasing on the 
  widest range of playback systems used by regular listeners
* **Nearfield** monitors design for close proximity to the listener
  - I.e. sitting on a desk infront of the monitor, **equilateral triangle** arrangement
  - Hear primarily the **direct sound** coming from the speakers (minimized reflections from room surfaces)
  - Compact two-way systems, tweeter and a moderately-sized (4-8") second driver
  - Good for small rooms and/or challenging room acoustics
* **Midfield** monitors (more powerful than nearfield)
  - Beefier power amplifiers provide **more bass extension and proper mid- and high-frequency dispersion at greater distances**
  - Have larger woofers (8-10"), sometimes three-way designs (with a dedicated midrange driver)
  - Can fill larger rooms with high-quality sound for multiple listeners positioned further away
  - Larger monitoring sweet spot, more volume ("bigger" sound)
* **Active** monitors including one or more internal power amplifier(s)
* **Bi-amplified**, separate low- and high-frequency amplifiers
  - Low-frequency part is routed to a **woofer**
  - High-frequency part is routed to a **tweeter**
* Input:
  - Stereo **RCA** connectors for soundcards
  - Stereo **1/8" TRS** (3.5mm Klinkenstecker) for CD/MD/Phones
  - **1/4" TRS** (6,35mm Klinkemstecker) for microphone, keyboards, etc..
  - **XLR** balanced audio interconnection (found on professional equipment)
* Output: 1/8" TRS for headphones
