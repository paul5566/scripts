Audio power amplifier (amp) **reproduces low-power electronic audio signals for driving (loud)speakers or headphones**.

* Typical loudspeaker has an impedance of between 4Ω and 8Ω
* Amps supply high peak currents to drive the low impedance speaker

Classes, broad indication of an amplifer's **characteristics and performance**:

* Amount of the output signal over one cycle of operation (by a sinusoidal input signal)
* A, B, AB and C for **analog** designs
* D, E, F, G, S, T etc **switching** designs (use digital circuits and pulse width modulation (PWM))
* Tradeoff between **power efficiency** (class D up to 90%) and **audio fidelity**
* **Class T**, inexpensive, efficent, lightweight, digital amplifiers
  - Real time control of the switching frequency depending on the input signal and amplified output
  - low distortion signal levels (of class AB) and power efficiency (of class D)
  - Use **DSP** (Digital Signal Processing)
