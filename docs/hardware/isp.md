ISP (in system programmer) is a technique to load code on PLDs (programmable logic devices)

* Enables re-programming (field updates) of micro-controllers (MCU) installed in a system
* It eliminates the need to manufacture PCBs (circuit boards) with pre-programmed chips (cost saving)
* PLDs supporting this have internal circuitry to communicate with the programmer via a serial protocol
* JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is a widely use standard protocol for ISPs
