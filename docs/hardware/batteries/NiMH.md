# NiMH

NiMH (nickel–metal hydride) batteries:

- Provide approximately 75% of the capacity of alkaline AA batteries
- Low drain rates, can surpass alkaline performance in high drain applications
- Significantly higher capacity than NiCd batteries
- Expected life of 2 to 5 years
- Do not have a “memory effect” like NiCd 

Capacities:

| Type    | Size | Capacity         |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Non-LSD | AA   | up to 2700mAh    |
|         | AAA  | up to 1100mAh    |
| LSD     | AA   | up to 2500mAh    |
|         | AAA  | up to 950mAh     |
|         | C    | up to 5000mAh    |
|         | D    | up to 9500mAh    | 

## Handling

* Don't mix batteries:
  - Of different manufacturers
  - Of different capacity
  - Of different chemistries (i.e. NiCd, Lithum)
* Don't exposes the battery to cold or extreme heat
* Remove the batteries when warm to the touch from a device/charger

**Cycle Life**, factor effecting charge/discharge:

- Capacity
- Temperature
- Discharge depth
- Charge/discharge current
- Exposer to over charge/discharge
- Age

### Charging

**Rated Voltage**: 

- A full charged AA cell should have a voltage of ~1.4V (at 20 degrees C)
- Fully charged cell supplies an average **1.25V** during discharge

**Continuous low rate charge** (aka overnight charging)

- Slow charge generally good for battery life
- Under these conditions several hundred battery cycles are possible
- Modern cells have an oxygen recycle catalyst to prevent damage on over-charge if the charge rate is less of equal to C/10
- 0.1C (C/10) or below 10% of the rated capacity over 12 to 14 hours
- Cheap charger with user management of the charge time

**Smart charger** (aka faster charging)

* The charger monitors the battery voltage change and prevent over-charging
* Moderate rate recommended C/3.33 for 5 hours
* **Fastest charging**
  - In 1.5 hours at 1C 
  - Temperature monitoring recommended, cells should stay below 45 degrees C
  - Impacts battery longevity
* Maintenance **trickle charge** rate < 0.025C (C/40) recommended (reduces negative effects of over-charging)

### Discharge

**Over-discharge** can push the battery into **cell reversal** (reversing polarity of the terminals) which permanently damages the battery. Therefore don't discharge below **1.0–1.1V** per cell.

**Self-discharge** can deplete a common NiMH cell within several month: 

- Depends on the environment temperature (lower temperature, slower discharge)
- 5–20% on the first day, stabilizes around 0.5–4% per day at room temperature

**LSD** (low self-discharge) NiMH batteries

- Typically maintain >75% of charge after 1 year
- Marketed under "Pre-charged", "Ready to use" or "Hybrid" since normal NiMH cells require to be charged before the first use


## Storage

* Store:
  - With **open circuit** (removed from the device) to eliminate loaded storage effects
  - In Fully **charged** condition
  - **Clean**, **dry**, protected environment to minimize physical damage
  - Use first in, first out to reduce time batteries spend in storage
  - Can generate high currents if shorted, sufficient to ignite flammable material
* After storage for extended periods of time multiple cycles required to attain
  pre-storage capacities
* Batteries stored under load for a prolonged time:
  - Deterioration caused by gas generation in the battery (activation of the safety vent)
  - Small quantities of electrolyte seep out around the seals or the safety vent
  - Creep leakage may result in the formation of crystals of potassium carbonate, can result in corrosion of batteries
