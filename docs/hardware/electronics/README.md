**Passive components** are the framework on which electric circuits are build:

- No active control behavior, responds to voltage and current
- Dissipates energy (resistors) or stores/releases energy (capacitor, inductor)
- Do not require a dedicated power supply ("glue" parts of the circuit)

**Active components** typically require an external power source and actively alter the circuit behavior:

- Transistors perform current amplification in proportion to changes in a small input signal.
- Diodes are considered active due to a nonlinear response to current and voltage.

Component specifications (so-called **datasheets**) describe limits and ratings:

- **Tolerance** (in percent), parts with less tolerance usually more expensive
- Precision parts should not be used unless for a specific reason (i.e. high-precision measurement)
- Exceeding the **working voltage** may deteriorate the components material resulting in failure
- Exceeding the **maximum voltage** may cause the current of arc across the material
- **Power rating** is the maximum amount of power can safely dissipate (in from of heat)

**Electrostatic Discharge** (ESD)

- Occurs when accumulated static charge is suddenly discharged (to ground)
- Can damage solid-state components if not handled/stored carfully
- ESD damaged components fail under stress in operation (after some period of time has elapsed)
