# Transistor

_Transistors provide amplification and/or switching capabilities._

* Semiconductor device with three or more elements are called Transistor
* Term derived from TRANSfer and resISTOR

Use-Cases:

* Control the flow of a much larger power/current then a controlling device
  (e.g. a micro-controller) can handle.
* Isolate different regions of complex circuits
* In small quantities used as simple switches, digital logic, and signal
  amplification circuits
* In big quantities used in Integrated Circuits (ICs) as part of computer
  memory, and microprocessors
