Graphical displays of two types:

* Vector displays
  - Display line by line, specified by endpoints
  - Directly control the electron beam of a CRT (cathode ray tube)
  - Periodical refresh required
  - Absence of aliasing
* Raster displays
  - Array of addressable dots, individually set to a color/intensity
  - Aliasing: jagged appearance of primitives on a raster device

# Flat Panel Displays

**LCD** (Liquid Crystal Display)

* Organic molecules that polarize light when an electric field is applied
* Sandwich of multiple layers:
  - Reflective layer (mirror)
  - Horizontal polarizer
  - Horizontal grid wires
  - Liquid crystal layer
  - Vertical grid wires
  - Vertical polarizer
* Deposit electronic charge on the intersection between horizontal and vertical
  electrodes sequentially row by row
* Speed limited by the time required to charge the intersection (250ms)
* Color added by additional color filters
* Typically backlit

**TFT** (Film Transistor Matrix)

* Array of transparent transistors deposited on an LCD
* Amplifies each pixel (higher contrast ratio)
* Pixel hold electrical start
* Pixel more rapidly switched (faster response time (25ms))
