# Capacitor

A capacitor (dt. Kondensator) is a device that **holds electrical charge** which discharges after the current stops. The amount of charge that a capacitor can store is measured in farads.

| Quantity    | Symbol | Unit  | Abbr. |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Capacitance | C      | Farad | F     |

Capacitors are manufactured to accept a defined **voltage maximum** (rating) before breaking. Like resistors, capacitors have a **tolerance** with their value.

## Types of capacitors

**Ceramic** capacitors:

- Physically tiny devices designed to hold small amount of charge.
- Non-polarized
- Charge/discharge quickly, therefore are often used in high-frequency circuits

**Electrolytic** capacitors:

- Offer increased capacitance, and are physically larger
- Polarized (indicated by a mark/strip on the device)
- Often used to smooth power supply voltages, and provide stability for components drawing high current quickly (prevent dropouts and noise in a circuit).

## Capacitor Values

Conversion chart for farads:

| Prefix | Abbr. | Value                     |
|--------|-------|---------------------------|
|        | F     | 10⁰ = 1F                  |
| Milli  | mF    | 10⁻³F = 0.001F = 1000uF   |
| Micro  | uF    | 10⁻⁶F = 0.001mF = 1000nF  |
| Nano   | nF    | 10⁻⁹F = 0.001uF = 1000pF  |
| Pico   | pF    | 10⁻¹²F = 0.001nF          |

### Ceramic

Ceramic capacitors have a numerical code printed on the device (i.e. 104):

- First two digits: Capacitor value in picofarads.
- Third digit: Number of zeros to append after the capacitor value.
