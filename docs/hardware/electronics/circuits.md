# Circuits

In order for electric current to flow an electric circuit is required. Basically
a **loop of conductive material** to interconnect electrical components which
control the current flow to perform a useful task.

Electricity  is used by electrical components within a circuit. Therefore
electricity is required to **power** an electric circuit. Circuits must be able
to store energy and transfer it to other forms like heat, light, or motion.
Energy stored in a circuit is called electric potential energy.

Fundamental components are resistors, capacitors and inductors

- All electric circuits can be equivalently represented by circuits with these
  components
- Components must add "enough" resistance to prevent the circuit from
  breaking/overheating

Electric **components** (aka electronic devices):

- Electrical **terminals** connect a component to a circuit
- Components a typically classified into: **active**, **passive**, and
  **electromechanical**
