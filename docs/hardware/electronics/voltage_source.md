## Voltage Source

A voltage source (dt. Spannungsquelle) provides electrical energy:

- A alternator or generator provides alternating current **AC** (dt. Wechselstrom)
- Batteries of solar cells provide constant voltage, **DC** (direct current) (dt. Gleichstrom)

If point a is positive with respect to point b, moving a positive charge around a circuit from a to b (or a negative charge from b to a) requires work:

- The difference between the two points it the **voltage polarity**
- Polarity is indicated by a positive **+**  point a and a negative **-** point b
- A **closed circuit** (dt. geschlossener Stromkreis) allows flow of electricity between points a and b
- An **open circuit** cuts the circuit, prevents the flow of electricity between point a and b

**Conventional Current Flow** gives the flow of electrical current from positive to negative, and **Electron Current Flow** around a circuit from negative to positive.

Ground **GND**, aka common (dt. _Masse_)

- Most **negative** point in the circuit with **0V** (zero volts)
- **Reference** point (dt. Bezugspotential) to measure voltage and current in a circuit
