## Wire

Wires for use on breadboards:

* Solid core wire [_Einkerndraht_] sold in spools of varying length.
* Pre-cut (stripped) wires in a kit in a few different colors and sizes.
* Male to male per wire with header pins attached
* Avoid: Stranded [_Drilldraht_], magnet or to thin wires.

**22awg** (American wire Gauge), **0.6mm** is the preferred diameter for the wire.

Accurate wire stripping remove the outer layer of plastic without defecting the underneath wire.

* Preferably use a wire stripper to remove a couple of millimeter plastic.
* Use the corresponding notch on the stripper depending on the wire gauge.
