# Flight Controller

* **FC** (Flight Controller) 
  - Primary function: **control motors thrust** corresponding to the pilots inputs
  - **Interface with sensors** to maintain the aircraft flight state
  - Configurable and programmable, to adjust multi-rotor behavior and flight characteristics
  - Support different **flight modes** aka profiles, e.g. self-leveling mode
* Sensors types:
  - **Gyro** (Gyroscopes)
  - **Acc** (Accelerometer)
  - Barometer (barometric pressure sensor)
  - Magnetometer (compass)
* Firmware software race/acro flying:
  - Cleanflight
  - Betaflight
  - Raceflight
* **Processor** F1,F3,F4
* Integrated **Voltage Regulator**
  - Power the FC board directly from the battery
  - Measures battery level
* Integrated **PDB** (Power Distribution Board)
* **RX** protocols
