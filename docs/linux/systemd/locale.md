## Keyboard

Keyboard **layout** (arrangement of keys on the keyboard):

* Each language has its own layout.
* QUERTY is the most widespread layout not confined to a particular geographical
  area. Name comes from reading the first six keys appearing on the top left 
  letter row of the keyboard.
* QWERTZ is the normal keyboard layout in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
* Layout variants represents the changes made to a “macro-layout” to adjust it 
  to a different language.

Keyboard mappings - **keymaps**- (key code referenced by a key press)

* Typically the language code is the same as its country code, e.g. `de` (German)
* **Modifier** keys used to perform alterations on regular characters
