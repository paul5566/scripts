**Modal Editor**, enables efficient work with text:

* Most time is spend to move (position) the cursor before editing text
* **Normal mode** is used to efficiently navigate in a text document
* Edit (add/delete) text in **insert mode**

### First Edit

Install [neovim](https://neovim.io/) on your computer, open a terminal and run
the `nvim` command. By default Vim starts in normal mode. 

1. Switch to **insert mode** pressing the `i` (insert) key
2. Enter some text, arrow keys and backspace work as expected
3. Press `Esc` to **return to normal mode**

Save the text into a file using a command. Every command starts with a double
point `:`. The **write command** `:w <filename>` followed by a file name saves
the text, i.e.  `:w test.txt`. Exit Vim with the **quit command** `:q`.

### Edit Files

Open a file using the `vim` command followed by a filename, i.e. `vim
recipe.txt`. Edit the text (write your favorite cooking recipe). Save the
changes in normal mode whenever you made significant changes with write `:w`.

Use the **edit command** `:e <filename>` to open another file. Use insert mode
to add some text, and save the file. Open the previous file with `:e`, note that
you can use `Tab` to autocomplete the filename.

Exit the editor with `:q`. Vim prevents you from losing unsaved changes unless
explicitly discarded with `:q!`. Save and exit with a combined command `:wq`.
