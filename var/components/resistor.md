# Resistor

Passive electronic component with a linear current-voltage relationship as stated by Ohm's law

- Used at any voltage/current combination within its dissipating **power rating** (aka wattage rating)
- Come in various sizes and package types (through hole with axial lead, and SMD)
- The greater the resistors power, the greater its physical size
- 

**Power rating** for surface mounted ranges from 0.05W-0.25W, for axial outline from 0.125W-2W.

## Color Bands

Through-hole resistors use **color codes** (aka bands) to indicate resistive value and tolerance using rings that encircle the body of the resistor:

- 4-band system: digit, digit, multiplier, and tolerance
- 5-band system: digit, digit, digit, multiplier, and tolerance

| Color  | Digit | Multiplier | Tolerance |
|--------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Black  | 0     | 1          |           |
| Brown  | 1     | 10         | ± 1%      |
| Red    | 2     | 100        | ± 2%      |
| Orange | 3     | 1,000      |           |
| Yellow | 4     | 10,000     |           |
| Green  | 5     | 100,000    | ± 0.5%    |
| Blue   | 6     | 1,000,000  | ± 0.25%   |
| Violet | 7     | 10,000,000 | ± 0.1%    |
| Grey   | 8     |            |           |
| White  | 9     |            |           |
| Gold   |       | 0.1        | ± 5%      |
| Silver |       | 0.01       | ± 10%     |
| None   |       |            | ± 20%     |

Surface-mounted resistors have **letter codes** printed on the device:

- First two digits: A single number representing the resistance value
- Third digit: Number of zeros to append after the resistance value

# Types

Three terminal variable resistors called **Potentiometer**:

- In effect a continuously variable voltage divider
- Exist in circular rotary form, or as linear/slider style

**LDR** (Light Dependent Resistor), aka Photocell photo-sensitive resistor:

- Changes resistance (in ohms) depending on a detected light strength
- Photocells are non-polarized, and resistance decreases in relation to a darker light source
- Cheap LDR CdS (Cadmium-Sulfide) cells are inaccurate and have a high variation
- Only enough to detect basic light changes

Resistive **humidity snesor** (aka humistor) responds to the amount of moister in gas surrounding it.
